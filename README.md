# MSc-Advanced-Project

Hi there,

This is my MSc Creative Computing Final Project.

My project's name is called forest concert. It's an interactive music playing website, meaning to create an immersive forest-like music through the major melody and different sound effects. It has 4 different themes, which are 4 different seasons, and a landing page for you to choose the different themes. Welcome to experience and give me some feedback.

The two folders within this repository, [website](https://github.com/Anca-Wang/MSc-Advanced-Project/tree/main/website) and [weblog](https://github.com/Anca-Wang/MSc-Advanced-Project/tree/main/weblog) record my source code and developing process respectively.

This is the landing page:
